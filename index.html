My entire life growing up, I knew I was going to be a doctor.  I studied science in undergrad and was nearing graduation when the internet came to my school.  Like everyone else, I was blown away by this new technology that let me instantly email my friends at school hundreds of miles away.<br /><br />
            This new technology ignited in me a passion for computers and business that was a stunning revelation.  Before this, I had never even taken a business or programming class and now I was considering dropping out of school.  In 1997, I taught myself HTML to build websites and then ultimately quit school to go to work for an internet company.
